pomodoro-chrome-extension
=========================

A chrome extension to do Pomodori timing, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Open Chrome
2. Browse to chrome://extensions
3. Tick the developer mode checkbox in the top-right
4. Click 'Load unpacked extension'
5. Browse to where you have checked out this repository
6. Select the 'build' directory
7. Click 'ok'

USAGE
-----

The extension is very simplistic in nature. Just click the tomato icon which appears in your toolbar, then start the timer.
When the time is up you will receive a notification.

The basics of the Pomodoro technique are as follows (and there are plenty of variations on this theme):

- Start your timer
- Work!
- If there are any interruptions, defer them until the timer runs out (e.g. If the phone rings, politely tell them you'll ring back in under 25 minutes).
- When the timer runs out, stop your main activity and deal with any interruptions you've deferred.
- Take a short break. 4 minutes is fine.
- Repeat.
- Every 4th iteration, take a longer break.
